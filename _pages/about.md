  Though my main role is Demand and Pricing Analyst, I played a key role in business analytics, evaluating project life cycles for strategic decision-making. I successfully developed and maintained tracking spreadsheets in MS Excel, generated impactful reports aiding management decisions, and utilized SalesForce for data modeling and trend forecasting.

  I've successfully overseen Marketing and External Affairs, managing procurement and supplier relations with major partners like Samsung, Epson, and Extron. My role included Research Development and Strategic Management, with a focus on Blue Ocean Strategy. Despite being a small underdog, we triumphantly secured significant projects with international clients such as the Asian Development Bank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, and Sunlife. Our success highlights the effectiveness of our strategy in navigating and thriving in competitive landscapes.
